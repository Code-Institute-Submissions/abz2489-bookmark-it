# UX/UI

## Strategy

### Project Goals
Bookmark-It is a platform that combines the functionalities of an e-commerce bookstore with the book-tracking features similar to Goodreads. In addition to offering books for purchase, users can conveniently bookmark titles they are currently reading, plan to read, or have already completed.

For avid readers, Bookmark-It offers added convenience by integrating purchasing capabilities directly. This means users can seamlessly transition from browsing and bookmarking books to purchasing them, all within the same interface.

User profiles on Bookmark-It include a dedicated section that provides insights into the reader's reading habits. This feature allows users to track the number of books they've read over a specified period, whether it's monthly or yearly.
